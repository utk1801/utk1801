### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


About me: I'm a Computer Science Graduate student studying at Stony Brook University @New York.

Recently I have concluded my CPT @Sony PlayStation as a Software Intern for 3 months. During this period, I was working under the Payments domain and was responsible for creating an abstraction service for their Payment Gateway.
In the past, I have worked for VISAâ€™s product reliability & engineering team for 4 years. I started off as a Systems Analyst, where in I was responsible for Infrastructure engineering, reliability monitoring and traffic management for highly critical business applications/services.

Later after 2 years I moved to the development space, which is when I started working on Agile methodology for their Identity & Access Management systems, and worked on developing features around SSO, Federation related workflows. 

With a blend of industry experience, along with the technical skills I have built during my Mastersâ€™ degree, I am keen to develop products that have a meaningful impact. I am currently looking for full time job opportunities with focus around Software, Cloud or Data Engineering roles.
